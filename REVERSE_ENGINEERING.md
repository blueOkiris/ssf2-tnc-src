# Documentation of Reverse Engineering

## Description

This is a document to record the steps I follow when trying to convert a disassembled ROM of "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers"

The code is in 65C816 assembly, and I want to remake the project in C. I will go through each bit of assembly code and try my best to reconstruct it.
