# Decompilation of Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers

## Description

Why? Why? Why?

The goal of this project is modding. I think it would be fun to tweak the SFII experience, and the SNES is well understood, and this is the version on the SNES.

Yeah, it's not Turbo. Weird decision, I know. However, if we get the source, we can speed it up anyway.

So yeah, I want to 1) build for PC, 2) upgrade graphics, 3) add mechanics, specifically parries from SFII Third Strike

## Decompilation (to C)

Deps:
- You need a ROM. I cannot give you a ROM. You must get a cartridge and rip it yourself.
- You need the [RSDKv4 decompilation toolkit]()

The initial decomp can be done with the `decomp.sh` script in the scripts folder.

## Building Current Source

Deps:
- Linux
- make
- g++

Just run `make`
